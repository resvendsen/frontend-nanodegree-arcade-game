How to start the game
=====================
Store the game files in a directory of your choice.  From that directory open the index.html file in your browser.  The game will start running immediately.

Playing the game
================
The game has enemy beetles and a game character icon to manipulate.  The goal is to successfully cross grass and cobblestones for a swim in the water.  Enemy beetles will
try to prevent you from getting across.  Gems also appear on the screen.  If you collect a gem by touching it, you receive nothing but kudos at the end.
You control your game character by using the "right", "left", "up", and "down" arrow keys.
Each time an arrow key is pressed the character moves one square on the board.
If you fail to make it to the water, the game will immediately restart.
The character icon will not move off the board.
Any time the character touches an enemy beetle, the game is over.
If you successfully make it to the water, a popup notice will inform you of your victory and the number of gems you got.
You may then choose "OK" to play again or "cancel" to quit.
